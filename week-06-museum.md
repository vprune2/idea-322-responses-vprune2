# Fortune Found in Cookies  

---

Museum exhibition *Fortune Found in Cookies* presents an archive of collected fortunes taken from "fortune cookies" given out as desserts at many Chinese restaurants. These fortunes are presented on small, rectangular strips of paper and are often companied by a list of lucky numbers and a translation of a Chinese word on the back. This collection features fortunes from different brands of fortune cookies dating from 2016 to 2023.  

> #### Mission Statement
> The mission of this exhibition is to share and contemplate the cultural phenomenon of fortune cookies, fortune-telling, and personal archives. There exists a fascination with wishes, luck, and predictions of the future in American culture that is oddly associated with other foreign cultures, fortune cookies being specifically associated with Chinese culture and food. *Fortune Found in Cookies* encourages viewers to question this tradition as well as consider the type of advice, predictions, and guidance that is found on these fortunes.
