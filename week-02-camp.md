## Susan Sontag Notes on Camp

# 23  
In naive, or pure, Camp, the essential element is seriousness, a seriousness that fails. Of course, not all seriousness that fails can be redeemed as Camp. Only that which has the proper mixture of the exaggerated, the fantastic, the passionate, and the naive.

Again, Camp is the attempt to do somehting extraordinary. But extraordinary in the sense, often, of being special, glamorous. (The curved line. The extravagant gesture.) Not extraordinary merely in the sense of effort.
